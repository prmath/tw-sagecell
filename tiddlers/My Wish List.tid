The implimentation is a bit of a hack. It would be great if we can integrate sagecell more into Tiddlywiki. For example:

* we can have `<$sagecell> </$sagecell>` widget with configurable settings.
* we can setup sagecell to read data from tiddlers, for example values of a field.

As I'm not a developer (and know nothing about javascript), this will remain in my dream :)
